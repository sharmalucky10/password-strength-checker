Password Strength Checker 

A simple yet effective cybersecurity tool built using Python that evaluates the strength of a password based on common security rules.
It provides clear feedback and suggestions to help users create stronger and more secure passwords.

Features:
- Checks minimum password length
- Verifies uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and special characters
- Classifies passwords as Weak, Medium, or Strong
- Provides actionable security suggestions

Technologies Used:
- Python 3
- Regular Expressions (re module)

How It Works:
1. User enters a password
2. Program analyzes the password using regex
3. A score is calculated
4. Strength and suggestions are displayed

How to Run:
1. Clone the repository
2. Run the Python file
3. Enter password when prompted

Cybersecurity Relevance:
Weak passwords are a major security risk. This project demonstrates basic password validation techniques.

Future Improvements:
- Web application using Flask
- Real-time strength meter
- Password hashing
